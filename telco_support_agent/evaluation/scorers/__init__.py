"""Telco support agent evaluation scorers."""

# TODO: at the moment, the custom scorers cannot be used in monitoring
# as such the current workaround is to use @metrics to define judges for monitoring
# future API release will allow for custom scorers to be used in monitoring
# when this is the case, we can remove the @metrics and use the custom scorers directly
